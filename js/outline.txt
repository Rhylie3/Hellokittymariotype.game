Enemy:
  #collideWidth
    checks collision. Bounces off of walls and other enemies. Kills HelloKitty.
    gets killed by block bonk from below

    Specific enemy behaviors:
      cats get replaced with a ball of them curled up
      the ball get kicked if touched from the side, instead of killing it

HelloKitty:
  #collideWidth
    gets expelled from walls, bonks blocks, destroys blocks as big Kitty
    note: collision with blocks is determined by which one is over the center
      if you're slightly to the side, you slip past it.
  Crazy-ass sprite shifting if you're in star mode!

Item
  #collideWidth
    item pickup logic

Cupcake
  #update
    movement logic for cupcakes
    get impulse from being block bonked
    this can be implemented by giving them the appropriate accel
    just if they overlap a block from the bottom.
    of course, only AFTER they finish sliding out of the block.
Water levels:
  make a separate class for water Kittys
    less gravity
    swimming sprite
    fireballs are the same
    jump works when not on the ground
  different enemies


TODO: Make level loader use hashes instead of arrays where possible.
Should be free performance gain.

Should also make item deletion less weird.

TODO: Make gravity exist higher up instead of having a magic number.
Note from the future: Nope. Different objects have different gravity.
